# Boltzgen design specification for PRODUCTION-SCALE protein binder to EGFR (1IVO)
# This design targets the EGFR kinase domain (chain A) with realistic production parameters
# 
# Design strategy:
# - Target: EGFR kinase domain ATP-binding site and activation loop region
# - Binder: Protein of 90-130 amino acids (typical for binding domains)
# - Goal: Generate high-affinity binder to EGFR therapeutic target
#
# This YAML is configured for production-scale generation with 10,000 intermediate
# designs refined to 10 final diversity-optimized candidates

entities:
  # Designed protein chain
  # Length: 90-130 residues (realistic for binding domain)
  # This range covers:
  #   - Small binding proteins (90-100 aa)
  #   - Medium domains (100-120 aa) 
  #   - Larger single-domain binders (120-130 aa)
  - protein: 
      id: E
      sequence: 90..130
  
  # EGFR kinase domain target from 1IVO structure
  # Chain A contains the complete kinase domain including:
  #   - ATP-binding pocket
  #   - Activation loop
  #   - Key regulatory regions
  - file:
      path: 1IVO.cif
      # Target the complete EGFR kinase domain (chain A)
      # This ensures binder designs can access multiple potential epitopes
