# Boltzgen design specification for nanobody against EGFR (1IVO)
# Designs a nanobody to bind the EGFR kinase domain

entities:
  # Specify a designed nanobody
  # Boltzgen will use one of its default nanobody scaffolds
  # and design the CDR regions
  - protein: 
      id: N
      sequence: 110..130  # Typical nanobody length range

  # Specification of the EGFR target from 1IVO structure
