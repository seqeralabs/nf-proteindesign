# Example Boltzgen design specification for peptide binder design
# This example designs a peptide to bind specific residues on a target protein

entities:
  # Specify a designed peptide chain
  # Random number between 12 and 20 of designed residues (inclusive)
  - protein: 
      id: G
      sequence: 12..20

  # Specification of the target extracted from a .cif file
  # Replace with your own target structure file
  - file:
      path: target_protein.cif
      # Which chain and residues in the .cif file to use as target
      include:
        - chain:
            id: A
      
      # Which regions of the target the design should bind to
      # Specify residue numbers on the target chain
      binding_types:
        - chain:
            id: A
            binding: 343,344,251  # Replace with your target binding residues
      
      # Which regions of the target should have their structure specified
      structure_groups: "all"
