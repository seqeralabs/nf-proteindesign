# Example Boltzgen design specification for protein binder design
# This example designs a protein to bind a target protein

entities:
  # Specify a designed protein chain
  # Random number between 80 and 140 of designed residues (inclusive)
  - protein: 
      id: C
      sequence: 80..140
  
  # Specification of the target extracted from a .cif file
  # Replace with your own target structure file
  - file:
      path: target_protein.cif
      # Which chain and residues in the .cif file to use as target
      include: 
        - chain:
            id: A
