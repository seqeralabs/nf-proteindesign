# Example Boltzgen design specification for nanobody design
# This example designs a nanobody against a target protein

entities:
  # Specify a designed nanobody
  # Boltzgen will use one of its default nanobody scaffolds
  # and design the CDR regions
  - protein: 
      id: N
      sequence: 110..130  # Typical nanobody length range
      # Optionally specify nanobody-specific constraints here

  # Specification of the target extracted from a .cif file
  # Replace with your own target structure file
  - file:
      path: target_protein.cif
      include:
        - chain:
            id: A
      
      # Optional: specify binding epitope if known
      # binding_types:
      #   - chain:
      #       id: A
      #       binding: 50,51,52,100,101,102  # Example epitope residues
